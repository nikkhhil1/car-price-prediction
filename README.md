1. Through data exploration , cleaning and outlier removal
2. Using various plots and maps with Seaborn to visualize and understand patternsðŸ“ˆ
3. Feature engineering , encoding categorical variables and fearure scaling using standard scaler
4. Training and evaluating regression models like Linear RegressionðŸ˜Ž
5. Developed a web app using Streamlit to make real time car price predictions through an interactive interfaceðŸ’»
